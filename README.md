# 🚢 Submarine Hunt
It's a simple game developed in #C. The gamer is the BattleShip, and he has to attack the Submarine in the ocean.

# 👾 "How do I play?"
``` #C
printf("\nBATTLESHIP'S POSITION: ");
// You write two numbers (from 0 to 2), for example: 0 1
// So, you are READY to attack the Submarine!
```
# 🤔 "Why did you develop this game?"
It was my final project for the subject of Algorithms as a freshman student of my course in 2022. Also, my final media was 8,6.

# 🔧 "What tools did you use?"

# 👩‍💻 "Are you the unic author?"
